## Algorithms Details

### 1. Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a fundamental algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the input and output.

- **Dataset:** Boston Housing Dataset
- **Key Features:**
  - Easy to implement
  - Interpretable coefficients
  - Suitable for small datasets

### 2. Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems. It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category.

- **Dataset:** Titanic Survival Dataset
- **Key Features:**
  - Works well with linearly separable data
  - Outputs probabilities
  - Can be extended to multi-class problems

### 3. Decision Trees

Decision Trees are versatile algorithms that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They split the data into subsets based on feature values.

- **Dataset:** Iris Dataset
- **Key Features:**
  - Easy to visualize
  - Handles both numerical and categorical data
  - Prone to overfitting

### 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVM is a powerful algorithm used for classification tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes.

- **Dataset:** MNIST Handwritten Digits
- **Key Features:**
  - Effective in high-dimensional spaces
  - Robust against overfitting
  - Requires careful tuning of parameters

### 5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

KNN is a simple, yet effective algorithm used for classification and regression. It predicts the output based on the k-nearest data points.

- **Dataset:** Wine Quality Dataset
- **Key Features:**
  - No training phase
  - Sensitive to the choice of k
  - Computationally expensive for large datasets

### 6. Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes independence among predictors.

- **Dataset:** SMS Spam Collection
- **Key Features:**
  - Fast and efficient
  - Works well with high-dimensional data
  - Assumes independence, which may not always hold
